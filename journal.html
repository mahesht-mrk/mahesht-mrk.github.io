						<li> Today I learned how to implement the lookup relationship in custom and standard objects in the lookup relationship there is no cascade deletion. </li>
						<li>I learned Master-Detail Relationship, in that relationship one is a master object, and another is a detail object. The master-detail relationship always is created by the detail side. The master object is the parent object and a detail object is a child object.</li>
						<li>In the master-detail relationship there is cascade deletion will available, if you delete the master object record the automatic detail object record gets deleted.</>
						<li> we also cover the lookup relationship in master-detail. If case the record is already present in the parent object, then in that condition we have to populate all record in the lookup field because the master-detail field is mandatory.</li>
						<li> I learned about Rollup summary. A rollup summary is always created in a master-detail relationship. </li>
